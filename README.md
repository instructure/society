# Society

Society analyzes and presents a social graph of relationships between classes in a Ruby or Rails project.

Please note that Society requires Ruby 2.1 or later.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'society'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install society

## Usage

From your terminal:

    society from path/to/models

and then open `doc/society/index.htm` in your browser.

The default format is HTML; you can skip the HTML interface and just get the
JSON by passing `--format json`

Note that all JSON data is timestamped (regardless of output format) to store
snapshots of your project over time.

## Updating assets

All JavaScript and CSS dependencies are checked into the repo, so any given
commit should have everything it needs. However, if you're developing the gem
and need to pull in updates from the
[society-assets](https://github.com/CoralineAda/society-assets) package, you
can do so on the command line with `$ bower update`.

## Recognition

Society was inspired by an original idea by Kerri Miller (@kerrizor).
